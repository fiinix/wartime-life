excerpt: Starting time-travel the hard way.

Like a true wartime housewife it turns out I'm starting this project in the traditional way: on my hands and knees scrubbing floors. Starting with the dirtiest bits, the bathroom and the kitchen, I'm turning our house back to 1943.

My first idea was to base it quite a lot on my own grandmothers house. She was born in 1921 and was an actual wartime housewife.. So I knew it was going to be lots of muted browns and greens in different stripes, but also I thought I'd take a wild guess and say that some of those old fashioned things I remember might actually fit in! My grandmother was a lot of things, but modern wasn't one of them.

On to google!

So..turns out 40’s isn’t a hugely popular vintage style. I had to get a bit creative..living museum pictures..old ads..lots of living-like-the-40’s-series. But I did make an interesting discovery! Although we are going for a British kind of wartime experience I thought I’d also check out some of the Swedish equivalent so I google ‘folkhemmet’. Folkhemmet is an ideal that came in the 1930’s that was meant to improve the life of the people and make a strong untied people (yes..it was the 30’s after all..). And it did improve a lot. In fact, I have lived much of my life in the houses build during that period and, to my surprise, I noticed I knew a lot more than I thought about decorating 40’s style.

So now I feel confident that I can do this!

The bathroom is first up. Mostly I just swapped plastic bottles for glass ones and put new labels on them, then some patriotic wartime propaganda of course!

Then I fixed up the entrance with a new curtain and a poster. I re-made some Primark hangers with fabric and cotton earlier and they get to hang out there for now too..

Next up is the rest of the kitchen. Luckily it seems I just have to change some things around and strip away my usual clutter (noooooo!).. but it will be ok. 

Now off to find a lampshade for my old lamp, a biscuit jar and then re-plant my basil.
