excerpt: "We've never had this many vegetables and fruits in our home and I'm not sure yet if I love it or hate it."

When we first started talking about living like it was World War II my first thought went to the food we would be eating. I imagined the delicious weekly steak and the weekend ales---2 but still---that I enjoyed and how I might sneak into the graveyard behind our house at night to eat some steak, like a feral woodsman.

I saw this picture in my head of cauliflower, carrots, turnips and swedes and all kinds of vegetables that I, quite frankly, just don't eat.

We, of course, researched and looked into what rationing would be like and a part of me began fearing that I would starve---not because of the taste of things but because it all sounded so, sparse.

###Weekly ration for 1 adult

- **Bacon & Ham** 113 g (4 oz)
- **Meat** to the value of 1 shilling and sixpence, around 540 g (1.2 lb)
- **Margarine** 113 g (4 oz)
- **Butter** 57 g (2 oz)
- **Lard** 57 g (2 oz)
- **Sugar** 227 g (8 oz)
- **Milk** 1.1 l (2 pints)
- **Loose Tea** 57 g (2 oz)
- **Sweets** 85 g (3 oz)
- **Egg** 1 fresh egg
- **Cheese** 57 g (2 oz)

**Fruits & Vegetables** As per availability

**Tinned Meats** 2 points / tin

Add to this a few more pints of milk and an extra egg for Lucien, who as a child will be getting a little bit more.

But then we actually bought a week's worth of rations today and set it up to take that picture and I looked at it. And that sensation of dread and despair that I had felt earlier became replaced with a different set of emotions, that of hubris and superiority.

"Surely we can do this, this is a ridiculous amount of food," I thought, "Nobody drinks that much tea."

Whilst some things, like butter, sugar and bacon were rationed quite quickly, other foods, like bread, weren't rationed until after the war. Other things, like tinned meats, fish and breakfast cereals were only available by an ever-changing point system.

Unless you got it on the Black Market, which was highly illegal and the penalties for getting caught could be quite severe.

We're also replicating the point system as well as we can and have already managed to use 4---for the Spam and Corned Beer---of the total 48 points we have for this month.

Anyway, I'm feeling pretty confident that I might not have to sneak out into the graveyard to stuff my face with a piece of steak. At least not any time soon.
