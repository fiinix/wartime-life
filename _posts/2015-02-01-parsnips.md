First day of the wartime experiment. Today it hit me that actually..this includes food too. Crap. 

I think this whole rationing thing will be really hard. Not because of the amount, that will be fine, and not because of the things it includes, which seems to be mostly potatoes, but because of some very specific things it excludes. 
Now, I’m not open minded about food. At all. I like some things and only those things and food experiments are harshly discouraged. No hot vegetable allowed. Sadly most of the things, not really very special things, that I’ve grown to live on are either severely rationed or non existent..and it’s been replaced by brown sauce and parsnips.

Today I made something that was both edible while both I and my food strongly reminded me of my dead grandmother..so that was odd in more ways than one! But I didn’t throw it up so I see it as a victory. 

I must say I was way more positive about this before we started. Reality hit me when I saw the miniature piece of cheese. Then I really felt the war creeping in.
