So this morning I’ve done some strange things. When my hair had dried enough after showering I rolled it up in my foam rollers. Then I put on red lipstick and bicarbonate of soda just like a 40’s woman and dressed in my skirt, knitted sweater and pearl necklace. So far so strange! But not exactly uncomfortable. It seems I’m adjusting pretty well, even enthusiastically, to doing all kinds of wartime stuff. Except for one thing.

I haven’t been able to bring my self to eating breakfast yet. It’s 12,30 in the afternoon. 

Lucien is home with a fever and since we decided that he would get a free pass on the wartime stuff in some cases he ate pain au chocolate and apple for breakfast. I on the other hand am starving and miserable. This wartime food really brings back more memories than I hoped for. 

I must say that thing they always say in those re-living history things is true, it’s all fun and games until you think of feeding it to your children.

And yes, I suppose if I had grown up in a more privileged home I’d be thinking of how healthy it would be for him and how he should learn to appreciate what he has..and maybe that’s true because now, in modern life, I am one of those who can give my child almost all he wants and it’s a struggle to set the appropriate boundaries so he doesn’t grow up to be a spoiled douche.

But I was not that child.

I did go hungry most of the time.

I have never appreciated my mothers lenience with me more then I do this day when letting me grow up on cheese bread and tomatoes in spite of well-meaning health preachers..or my grandmothers (the one I still have) everyday-is-pancake-day attitude to us kids. Because there is something deeply humiliating about an authority telling you what you may and may not survive on.

You just don’t realize how important liking your food is until you don’t. Or remember it.

So now I’m going to re-think how strictly I’m going to follow the rationing in food this month. 

Part of me wants to be authentic. But another part just wants to try out the hard bits and then keep the shoes and vegetables forever.
