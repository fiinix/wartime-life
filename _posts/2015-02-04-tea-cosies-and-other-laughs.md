excerpt: "How I was picked up by my family and crocheting."

The first real wartime day really crushed me. It really did. Old memories of things forgotten flared up again and the good old eating disorder was back with a vengeance. In the end I sat on the bathroom floor crying.. both in complete understanding of the desperation real wartime mums must have felt..but also because my eyes were opened to how my own childhood might have looked like from a grown up perspective.

Things do look a lot different as an adult. 

So after having talked it over I decided to give my self a break every now and then. In fact I had that option all along but something in my brain just snapped and I had to be pulled back to reality (Thank you for that).

The next day I sank right into my new 1940’s personality! And it’s so much fun! For the first time in my life I got victory rolls to stick in my hair, and I have tried a lot, and went outside in my new/old clothes. I like the 1940’s hairdos, they feel so practical when looking glamorous.

I was also not at all as cold as I thought I’d be. Keeping warm is already a daily occupation for me so I really dreaded the bare legs, but actually...wool is ridiculously warm. Itchy, but warm.

I also noticed that 1940’s me is a little sassier then modern me so that was fun! It’s been a while since I told truck drivers to fuck off. Why you would even catcall a woman in a granny skirt is beyond me but still..

In the day I did my usual cleaning up but I also had time to arrange my red lipstick collection and crochet a tea cosy. Just the name tea cosy makes me laugh but it’s also one of those ‘so ugly it turn nice’ kind of things and looking at that always cheers me up! Then I tried out some “wartime exercises”, as in mostly doing weird movements over and over again. Also fun!

Then I learned a little about the holocaust and the war in general. It’s a good time to be updating ones mind on things like that, partly because of our experiment of course but also because our social climate today is very similar to the one in the 30’s.

I think everyone should take a moment to think about what we are all capable of doing under the right.. wrong? circumstances.

In the afternoon when Lucien came home we made the weirdest dinner I’ve ever made: root-vegetable soup, spam..and potato fingers. Seriously though, it was 90% mash potato.  It took about forever to make, like most wartime food, but I must say it wasn’t nearly as bad as I had imagined! Wartime recipes tend to be pretty salty and lots of making the same things look like different things but I’m kind of fine with that.

I really liked the potato fingers! Lucien liked spam as always (he actually asked for a spam sandwich this morning). Carlos liked the soup, which is still a mystery to me, I thought it tasted a little too much like turnip, but hey, something for everybody!

Then we did another very 1940’s thing.

We played Cluedo.

Carlos got us some games to play now that we are going to, at least, try to cut down on our electronic dependency and I must say I’m really enjoying doing things together like we do now. But I suppose that was expected.

After living a day to the sound of the Andrew Sisters I though I should end it with a hot water bottle, Agatha Christie and a lady sherry. In the clingiest nightdress I’ve ever owned of course.

I think this will be fine after all.

Good night.
