excerpt: "Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names wereâ€” Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter. Peter was delicious."

To crown having survived a week of rationing---metaphorically of course, as we thankfully have the luxury of something bombs---I went out, in true wartime spirit, and got us some rabbit.

When I say, "went out---", I unfortunately mean, "---to the buthers" as I haven't ventured into actually hunting for rabbit just yet. Apparently it's perfectly legal to do so and if I'm being honest, I'd be curious to try it.

The beautiful anachronistic dissonance between hunting for rabbit with a trap of my own making and then watching a Youtube video on how to skin said rabbit seems too enticing to pass on.

But until I do, the butchers would have to suffice.

The verdict is as follows;

First, Rabbit is delicious and, to my surprise, we all liked it. We'll definitely have it again. Maybe during our Wartime experiment, maybe even after that.

Two, there's a lot less meat on a rabbit than I imagined. But despite this I still managed to squeeze two meals out of it---I'm patriotic as can be, and ration points won't worry me!---which is how we got to enjoy rabbit stew on Saturday and roasted rabbit with roast potatoes on Sunday.

If you've never tried it, I can wholeheartedly recommend rabbit.
