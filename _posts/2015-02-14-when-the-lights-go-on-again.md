I haven’t yet gotten in anyway comfortable wearing wartime clothes. I suppose I’m used to clothes being a little more...allowing. Now it’s all stockings, wool and lipstick...

First of all I want to share one thing I’ve noticed: People treat you more politely when dressed in wartime clothes! I don’t know if it’s that I look more proper in other people’s eyes or if it is that I actually behave better in them. It could honestly go either way. But I enjoy being called madame either way.

So far I quite like most of my 1940’s outfits. I can say that now because I’ve almost gone trough them all. I was really happy about my grey wool skirt the first couple of days because they were biting cold! Either with under dress and wool jumper or with a top and underskirt it actually kept me really warm..but it did itch pretty badly.

Next up was my favourite,  my one and only black dress, the actually wartime one that my friend once  picked up from a dead woman. It is wool so I can’t wear it without my under dress but I love it. Warm but classy..even if it is a bit short after I accidentally shrunk it. Shit happens.

Then it’s the stripy skirt I brought with me to England with an orange shirt and my orangey jumper. For once no wool! And it goes really well with my cute but painful 1940’s shoes.

Lastly there’s my swing-skirt and green jumper. That’s by far the comfiest of my clothes now..and that says a lot. I wore this on my last night in Scandinavia for our moving away party. I was dressed as 1945.

Even Lucien has gotten relatively used to his wartime outfit. He only has the one for now. I crocheted the vest before and the rest is just his own clothes. Just another example of how, in some ways, we don’t actually have to change all that much for this, just a bit of tweaking.

My skirts have gotten shorter, Carlos wears a tie for the first time ever (probably) and Lucien’s vest is now a woolly one.

The thing I find hardest though is the hair. I’m not generally very good at hairstyles and such but I think it really makes the style of this era and that, along with the music, is what keeps me focused. I did once get the victory rolls to look like the real thing! but that’s a lot of work. My usual hairstyle looks more like Ruth Goodman in Wartime Farm, lot’s of twisted hair out of the way.

My favourite one though is foam curled hair tied up with a scarf with one front bit twisted up! Easy and adorable.

So yesterday I made my self a green scarf too so I’ll have some options.

There is something strange about living the tips from wartime books though. For one thing, one smells different when wearing wool all the time, switching out deodorant for bicarbonate of soda and using oil as moisturiser. Not bad just..different. And the lipstick! The red lipstick has changed into both smelling and looking a lot like the ones I used to find in my granny’s house.

That did surprise me

But I figured out how to wear red lipstick and not smudging everywhere. Put lots on and then kiss a paper towel. Aside from that there isn’t anything else to say about the make up..only lipstick and eye-liner. Feels kind of clean and practical. Like most things in this era.

Now, I haven’t yet tried my 40’s patterns so that will be something for next week. I would like to have a swing dress actually..
