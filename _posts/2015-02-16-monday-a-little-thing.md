I think in a way because of being a seamstress the clothes have become my favourite part of the wartime experiment. I like the clothes and I like making and mending things on a small scale as I do now. It’s not in it self that different from normally but I get to try out making things I wouldn’t normally make and that’s a lot of fun.

Like this sweater-vest for Carlos! If I’m lucky I’ll get it done until the last week of wartime.
