Today has been one of those days that I spend 90% of it in the kitchen.

So it feels at least.. I’m not really a kitchen/cooking forever kind of person so now my back aches and there’s flour in my hair... which is kind of nice today btw, I’ve started to master this 40’s look!

Thing is I wanted to make Carlos some surprise Shrove Tuesday buns. He loves them but I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to make them on a ration.

Luckily though there’s one thing that’s not been in short supply in our house: sugar. Unlike many others we don’t ever, since we are Scandinavian, eat a lot of desserts. No puddings after dinner or cakes for Sunday (or whatever it is you guys do).. so there was plenty of cake making ingredients left!

The only thing I did have to exchange was the milk (halved the butter and egg... yes that was a challenge.) It’s all reconstituted dry milk this year, but it worked out really well and they were delicious. Not sure where the cream falls into the system but I’ll let that slide...

Recipe just in case.

*Wartime Scandinavian Shrove Buns:*

*1 egg
½ bag dried yeast
50g butter
½ dl reconstituted dry milk
½ dl sugar
a little salt, cardamom and flour until it thickens.*

*Blend butter and milk and make it body temperature. Add yeast then ½ egg, salt, sugar and cardamom. Blend and then add enough flour for it to become baby-bum smooth. Let stand for 30 minutes then roll into buns, spread the rest of the egg on top of the buns and sprinkle sugar on top. Then bake in the over until they are golden.* 

As you probably figured out I’m no calm and methodical kitchen goddess but neither does one have to be. I’m actually loving the carelessness for recipe in that way, I’m just making do!

And to the delight of my mother-in-law I actually baked bread too while the oven was hot---National loaf---we’ll see how that one turns out later.
