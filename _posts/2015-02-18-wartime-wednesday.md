So how did the National loaf turn out? Pretty awesome if I may say it my self! I did not have high hopes for this one...When I first took it out It really did look like a wholemeal turd but it tasted pretty good.

Me and Lucien even fought over who’s getting the last spam/cheese toastie!

“It looked crap, smelled crap but then you bite into it and it’s pretty nice,” said Carlos and gave it a 4.

Yes we rate our food on a 1-5 scale. Makes it fun.

I’ve baked a lot of basic bread before and the only real difference in this one is that it’s all wholemeal, it has potato flour in it as well as lard and it’s supposed to be vitamins in it. I skipped on the vitamins since I didn’t have any child friendly ones but otherwise.

Thadaa! National loaf.
