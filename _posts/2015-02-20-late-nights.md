excerpt: "These are the streets I walk on."

Looking at the condensation on the window squares I remember.. This is what I wanted all along. Back when I sat in my snowy Nordic small town and wondered what it would have been like.

When I sometimes watched  ‘Wartime Farm’ or ‘Supersizers Go Wartime’ and listened to the Andrew Sisters I did wonder what it would be like to have been English, to walk on those streets, what little things would be different.

Now I’m getting the vaguest idea.. and it’s calming. Moving past the things that struck me as way too familiar I’m starting to get a grip on what it’s all like.

I’m starting to feel like I’ve found my place in this story I’m telling in my head.

About [70 people died from the bombing in Maidstone during the war][bbc]. On Halloween in 1940 bombs fell on Mill street and killed 6 people.

I walk on that street often but now I might see it a little differently.
