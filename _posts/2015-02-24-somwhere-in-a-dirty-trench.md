excerpt: "I wouldn't even have been around."

I was really excited about experiencing first-hand---at least as much as I could be and as excited as it makes sense to be about something awful---the rationing and austerity of World War II.

I wanted to dress the part as well. So I researched it, or at least tried to.

It is really disheartening to understand that.. well, actually, I wouldn't have been around at all.

Had this actually been 1943 I would have been sent out to the front lines years ago, somewhere in a dirty trench and that's if I'm lucky. In reality it's more likely I would already be dead.
